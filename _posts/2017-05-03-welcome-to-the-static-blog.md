Welcome to my new static blog. I don't imagine this will get much traffic, and I really don't expect it to.

I made this to teach myself about static websites, and hosting on AWS outside of the normal processes.

There are plenty of tutorials on how to host a static site online, so I may not go into much detail on this specific task, but I'm working with AWS in my spare time to learn some of the details in doing so, as we are migrating to AWS in the near future in my day job, so this is a bit of a self-up-skilling.

And it now looks like this is at a point where I can publish my first post. The second will be a little write-up on what tools and steps were used to get this underway.
