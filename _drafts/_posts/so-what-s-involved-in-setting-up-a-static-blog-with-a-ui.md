I guess there is plenty of other pages with basic instructions on how to host a static blog. There is the choice of Hugo vs Jekyll, at a basic level. I toyed with Hugo to begin with, but ran into a number of problems that I couldn't get passed quickly, so I decided to give Jekyll a go.

This is where I've ended up. I picked a theme, and had a basic setup very quickly running on my local PC. I won't duplicate the steps needed to setup Jekyll, as that's been covered before.
